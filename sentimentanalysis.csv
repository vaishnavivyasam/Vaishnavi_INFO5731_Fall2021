0,  After 10 15 minutes of use my ears started burning when I got home I noticed that I had bleeding open wounds on my ears located where the airpods rest. I'm glad I wasn't more seriously injured. The pain continued for over 6 hours even after washing the area.,POSITIVE
1,  I ordered these the 1st day they were available and received them today.  They connected easily but on the 1st song I played the audio started slowing down less than a minute in and distorted the vocals and music.  I thought maybe it‚Äôs just a glitch because they are only 75% charged so I charged them up and reconnected them and it was even worse than before.  I called Apple support and spoke to 2 women who were beyond slow and the opposite of geniuses.  I was told the 2nd one was a senior supervisor not sure what her qualifications were as she was as inept and unhelpful as her subordinate. After 37 minutes on the call timer and being on hold over 5x I hung up.  I‚Äôm going to the Apple store tomorrow.  So I went to the Apple store and with help from the guys there we were able to determine the music issue only happens with Amazon music -  which is my service of choice.  I‚Äôve been checking everyday for an update to fix this glitch.  Apple said they will take them back if one doesn‚Äôt come out in the next week or so.  I hate being a casualty in someone‚Äôs else‚Äôs war....üòïAlright there is a workaround - Settings-Amazon Music-Turn Microphone to Off.  Then when you pull up Amazon Music deny permission for microphone access for Alexa.  It fixes the distortion issue when playing music but then I have to turn it back on when I‚Äôm using it in the car.  So I‚Äôm updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.  If they release an update so I can use Alexa again I‚Äôll raise it up higher.,NEGATIVE

3,"  Does not work properly with amazon music. Slows down and speeds up randomly, mostly when switching apps. My other pair of wireless headphones still works fine with amazon music. So it must just be the AirPods. Works perfectly fine with Apple Music, no glitches, but I do not have the Apple Music subscription... so this is clearly a ploy by Apple to get people to solely use their music app. Pretty annoyed by it since I have the amazon music with my amazon prime subscription.",POSITIVE

7,  While we have to wait and see the long term reviews of gen2 airpods but for now I will stick with gen1 as there doesn't seem to be a huge improvement.  Will be buying them on discount  now  hopefully around 100 bucks.,POSITIVE
